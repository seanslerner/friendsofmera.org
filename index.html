            Who are the Friends of MERA?
          </h1>
          <div>
            <p> We are a very concerned group of people including those who invested in MERA by way of donating money for the original purchase, by building an over 40-mile system of trails, and who regularly use MERA. Our rapidly growing group includes people with different backgrounds including some with expertise in forest management, soil science and forest ecliogy.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Friends of MERA:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li> Are committed to maintaining and developing the recreational values of the MERA. </li>
              <li> Want to preserve the aesthetic and ecliogical values of MERA while supporting best practices to promote forest health, and, </li>
              <li> Will promote awareness of and mitigate wildfire risk based on current science and forest management expertise. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p> In spite of strong objections from Friends of MERA and facts showing that the proposed logging and mastication method, and timing of logging would cause significant damage to the watershed and aesthetic values, Union County logged a ~50 acres area December 2021 through March 2022. As projected, the methods used to log and masticate, and timing of the project caused significant impacts to trails and the watershed (see document on the web page that was sent to Union County Commissioners on 5/10/10/22). Union County removed large fire-resistant pines and destroyed the natural beauty of the acre 50 area. Based on an email we received from Sean Chambers Union County on 4/28/22, the logging operation lost the County $39,796.00? “Project cost is estimated at $224,000.00 with revenues of $184,204.00 for a profit of $39,796.00.”  (see Photos on website)
            </p>
            <p>Please refer to document on this web site: Mount Emily Recreation Area, Union County Oregon, Forest Stewardship plan, 2012. The purchasers of MERA clearly bought it to be managed as a recreation area using sound and scientific principles. MERA has been successful beyond what anyone thought. We would like to honor that as forest management proceeds.</p>

            Concerns of Friends of MERA
          </h1>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li> We support projects designed to improve and maintain forest health. However, REMOVAL OF LARGE TREES is not good forest science and does not reduce fuels loading or fire danger. The logging done the winter of 2021-2022 included the removal of many healthy large diameter trees, which provides no reduction in fire risk and is contrary to the values associated with recreation area--a requirement of the grant money used to purchase the property.  Please see page 26 of the Forest Stewardship plan included on this website. </li>
              <li> We want the area not to be treated as an industrial forest but to use forestry practices that include visual/aesthetic parameters (see page 27 of Forest Stewardship plan) </li>
              <li> We want there to be better protection of soils. The abundance of large ruts in last winter’s logging is unacceptable and already enough area to restore. </li>
              <li> We want a variety of trails for the various user groups that are constructed using sustainable techniques and maintained. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3><b>Considerations</b></h3>
            <ul>
              <li> People come to MERA to because it offers a tranquil, beautiful area with uneven aged forest and great views. </li>
              <li> Large trees remain in short supply due to a legacy of logging.  Large trees over 21-inch diameter now make up only 3% of trees in the Blue Mountain Forests </li>
              <li> Large trees survive fire better and are key sources of abundant post-fire  re-seeding essential for forest regeneration after fires. Retaining large, fire tlierant trees is a key principle of dry forest restoration and increasing resilience. </li>
              <li> The importance of large lid trees as habitat for animals and other plants is so considerable that they can act as ‘biodiversity hotspots’ by supporting far more species than elsewhere in the surrounding landscape.</li>
              <li> Large trees get their water supply from deep in the earth-allowing shrubs and smaller trees the surface nutrient </li>
              <li> Protecting them for ecliogical reasons also supports maintenance of aesthetic, symbliic, religious, and historic values. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p> We understand that some large trees may be diseased or dying. Remove those that are a threat to the survival of other large trees or pose a threat to safety; however, consider whether a dead or dying tree can be retained safely. These larger structures (snags), provide a huge ecliogical rlie for many many species and people value them as well.</p>
