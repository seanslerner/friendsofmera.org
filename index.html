              <p>In spite of strong objections from Friends of MERA, the county proceeded to move forward with a forest management plan in the Winter of 2021-22 that used methods to log and masticate a 50 acre area of MERA resulting in significant damage to trails and the watershed. The attached photos tell the story. Large fire-resistant pines were removed using large equipment and skidders that totally destroyed the ground. Large piles of slash that will take years resolve destroyed the natural beauty along several trails.</p>

            Detailed Concerns of Friends of MERA
          </h1>
          <div>
            <ol>
              <li> <b>We support projects designed to improve and maintain forest health. However, REMOVAL OF LARGE TREES is not good forest science and does not reduce fuels loading or fire danger.</b> The logging done the winter of 2021-2022 included the removal of many healthy large diameter trees, which provides no reduction in fire risk and is contrary to the values associated with recreation area--a requirement of the grant money used to purchase the property.  Please see page 26 of the Forest Stewardship plan included on this website. </li>
              <li> We want the area not to be treated as an industrial forest but to use forestry practices that include visual/aesthetic parameters (see page 27 of Forest Stewardship plan) </li>
              <li> We want there to be better protection of soils. The abundance of large ruts in last winter’s logging is unacceptable and already enough area to restore. </li>
              <li> We want a variety of trails for the various user groups that are constructed using sustainable techniques and maintained. </li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <h3><b>Considerations</b></h3>
            <ul>
              <li> People come to MERA to because it offers a tranquil, beautiful area with uneven aged forest and great views. </li>
              <li> Large trees remain in short supply due to a legacy of logging.  Large trees over 21-inch diameter now make up only 3% of trees in the Blue Mountain Forests </li>
              <li> Large trees survive fire better and are key sources of abundant post-fire  re-seeding essential for forest regeneration after fires. Retaining large, fire tlierant trees is a key principle of dry forest restoration and increasing resilience. </li>
              <li> The importance of large lid trees as habitat for animals and other plants is so considerable that they can act as ‘biodiversity hotspots’ by supporting far more species than elsewhere in the surrounding landscape.</li>
              <li> Large trees get their water supply from deep in the earth-allowing shrubs and smaller trees the surface nutrient </li>
              <li> Protecting them for ecliogical reasons also supports maintenance of aesthetic, symbliic, religious, and historic values. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p> We understand that some large trees may be diseased or dying. Remove those that are a threat to the survival of other large trees or pose a threat to safety; however, consider whether a dead or dying tree can be retained safely. These larger structures (snags), provide a huge ecliogical rlie for many many species and people value them as well.</p>
<br>
            <h2>Mastication and the use of large equipment</h2>
            <p>Union County used an inappropriate method of logging and a form of mastication the winter 2021-2022 that resulted in an abundance of large ruts, destruction of soils and water quality impacts. Heavy slash along trails and “butchered/clear cut openings” are unsightly and will take decades to heal</p>
            <br>
<h3><b>Considerations</b></h3>
            <p>Mastication exacerbates weed problems and leaves the forest floor in a condition that is aesthetically displeasing and unsuited to those who enjoy walking off trail through the area.</p>
            <p>Fire scientists are now pointing to the role of invasive grasses in fueling wildfires. Thinning with skidders and tracked vehicles not only spreads invasive grasses but opens area to more light and increased forest temperatures resulting in hotter faster burning fires.</p>
            <p>Based on information made available to Friends of MERA, the cost of mastication is equivalent hand cutting/piling/burning. Why was mastication chosen?</p>

            Our Ask to the Union County Commissioners
          </h1>
          <div>
            <h3>1. Develop a public process for communication and decision making for MERA. </h3>
            <p>Do not log the remainder of the Red Apple Forest Improvement Project proposed for 12/2022. Stop and reconsider the current plan. It would be shameful for the next 300 hundred acres to look like the first 50 acres that were treated this past winter. </p>
            <p>Sponsor a public walkover of the RAFIP. There is much to be learned from this forest health project and the public and taxpayers deserve a chance to understand what occurred and why, and to voice an opinion on the outcomes.</p>
            <p>Engage the public and the MERA Advisory Committee on forest management and other MERA projects and management decisions. The MERA Advisory Committee was set up to help with public communication and decision making. However, the MERA Advisory Committee was bypassed on the RAFIP project--there was never a votes on the RAFIP project.</p><br>
            <h3>2. Update the MERA Forest Management Plan and Overall Management Plan </h3>
            <p>Both of these plans are outdated. Forest science with regards to wildland fire behavior has seen major shifts in historic paradigms. Use of MERA by the public is 1,000-fold greater today than it was in 2008 when the County acquired MERA. A MERA user survey is underway at this time that in the next year will quantify the value of MERA to Union County taxpayers and the region. Many volunteers have invested thousands of dollars and thousands of hours to make the MERA what it is today. MERA users and volunteers deserve an opportunity to provide input to future MERA management decisions.</p><br>
            <h3>3. Complete reclamation of the watershed and reconstruct trails damaged by RAFIP, and chip and spread biomass detained in slash piles.</h3>
            <p>It is very important the County follow through on commitments made in 2021 (Sean Chambers 11/10/21) with regards to reconstructing trails damaged by RAFIP. From a forest health/watershed standpoint, it is very important that the County initiate watershed and soil reclamation practices to regain some of the lost forest productivity and to reduce impacts to stormwater quality. The deep ruts and associated soil displacement shown in most of the photos in the attached photos, will be not heal without reclamation.  With regards to slash detained in the large piles from RAFIP, please give consideration, from a watershed health and air quality standpoint, to chipping and spreading the residuals from these piles on MERA. Mobile chippers are available to complete this work.</p>

            A Brief History of MERA Forest Management
          </h1>
          <div>
            <p>Union County received grants to acquire MERA at no cost to the county taxpayers. The return on investment to Union County and the region is immense—both economically and from a quality-of-life perspective.</p>
            <p>It was exciting when the county acquired MERA in 2008—creating a recreation area for the enjoyment of all the people of Union County, the region and for those travelling through NE Oregon. Over 40 miles of trails have been built with the sweat equity of many local residents and grants. Using the actual costs of $36,296 per mile, based on costs of building similar trails at Anthony Lakes, the value of MERA trails can be estimated at $1,451,840.</p>
            <p>MERA use has increased 1,000 fold since acquisition by Union County. During summer MERA provides great hiking, mountain biking, trail running, and berry picking. Specific trails are provided for equestrians too. Exceptional views of the Grand Ronde Valley, Eagle Cap Wilderness, Elkhorn Mountains are visible from trails. During winter months, MERA provides snowshoeing, skiing (cross country and backcountry) and groomed trails for fat biking. During the busy time of the year, more than a 1,000 people a week use MERA. On weekends the motorized and non-motorized parking areas are at are near capacity—many people are from out of state and out of the country! According to the Union County Chamber of Commerce (5/11/22) MERA is the No. 1 recreation attraction in Union County. from out of state, as MERA is responsible for bringing tourists and the significant dollars they spend to our area.</p>
            <p>MERA is managed by the Union County Commissioners. There is widespread agreement about the need for science-based forest management and fire prevention in MERA. However, there is significant disagreement about how to accomplish this and the County Commissioners continue to opt for the lowest cost and potentially highest return of logging and fuels reduction—though on the Red Apple Forest Improvement Project, neither of these goals were achieved!  </p>
            <p>In August of 2020, many users were alerted to a plan to log by blue markings on large diameter trees marked for harvest along main trails. A group of concerned users arranged a walk through with Sean Chambers (MERA manager), and Chuck Sarret (Union County forester), attended by 38 people. We expressed our concern for removal of large healthy trees, presumably for their economic value, using processes that would damage the trail system and the beauty of the area. Our group thought we had reached some understanding of specifics related to protecting the area. This included limited removal of large trees and avoidance of use of large equipment.</p>
            <p>Fast forward, local residents learned that the county was not going to honor discussions of August 2020 and they planned to close MERA the winter of 2021-22 into early summer for a major logging operation, using equipment that would damage trails and promote undergrowth that increase fire risk. The plan included removal of 30 inch in diameter trees that are fire resistant—trees wider than many people’s outstretched arm span.   The county intended to send out a request for logging bid on November 15, closing November 22, 2021 and to award the contract by December 10, 2021. The county posted a notice on the bulletin board at MERA that there would be a meeting November 10 to announce the plan. If some users, now known as Friends of MERA, had not alerted the newspaper and social media, the sale would have occurred without further public input. The parking lot was packed with concerned MERA users concerned with the plan.
</p>
            <p>Subsequently, many MERA users testified at a commissioner meeting December 1 to object to this plan.   Despite the concerns and requests to postpone the proposed logging plan, the county commissioners, responsible for the decision, proceeded with the plan proposed by Sean Chambers and Chuck Sarret. They immediately reposted an RFP to proceed with logging, signed a contract and logged a section of 50 acres, including Skills, and Lower Hot Shot, and Bridlevail during the winter of 2021-2022, resulting in significant damage to the area as described under “Current Concerns”.</p>
